## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS variables
- Basic JS
- JS method eval

### What I learned

I learned a couple of things in js...

I learned about regex
```js
const calculatorRgx = /^(?:[0-9./*x+\-]+|)$/; // accepts numbers and signs
const numberRgx = /^\d+$/; // Accepts only numbers
const signsRgx = /(?<=[0-9])([-+*/])(?=[0-9])/; // Accpets signs only if they are between numbers
const consecutivesSignsRgx = /[+\/x-]{2}|[.]{2}/; // Accpets consecutive signs and dots
const twoDotsRgx = /^(?=.*\..*\.).+$/ // Accpets 2 consecutive dots
```

How to use eval
```js
screen.value = eval(result); // Display result
```

And how to use setTimeout
```js
function changeBgClr(item, time) {
    item.classList.add('bg-color');
    setTimeout( () => item.classList.remove('bg-color'), time);
}
```
